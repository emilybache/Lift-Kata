Python version of Lift Kata
============================

Run the tests using pytest:

	python -m pytest

If you have a diff tool installed locally that you would like to use, I suggest installing [pytest-approvaltests](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-approvaltests/) and using it to configure pytest.
